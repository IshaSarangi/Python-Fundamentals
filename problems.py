Write a python program to find and display the product of three positive integer 
values based on the rule mentioned below:

1. It should display the product of the three values except when one of the integer value is 7. 
2. In that case, 7 should not be included in the product and the values to its left also should 
not be included.
3. If there is only one value to be considered, display that value itself. 
4. If no values can be included in the product, display -1.

Note: Assume that if 7 is one of the positive integer values, then it will occur only once. 
Refer the sample I/O given below.

FoodCorner home delivers vegetarian and non-vegetarian combos to its customer based on order.

A vegetarian combo costs Rs.120 per plate and a non-vegetarian combo costs Rs.150 per plate. 
Their non-veg combo is really famous that they get more orders for their non-vegetarian combo than the vegetarian combo.

Apart from the cost per plate of food, customers are also charged for home delivery based on the distance in kms from the restaurant to the delivery point. The delivery charges are as mentioned below:

Distance in kms     Delivery charge in Rs per km

For first 3kms          0

For next 3kms           3

For the remaining       6

Given the type of food, quantity (no. of plates) and the distance in kms from the restaurant to the delivery point,

write a python program to calculate the final bill amount to be paid by a customer. 

The below information must be used to check the validity of the data provided by the customer: 

Type of food must be ‘V’ for vegetarian and ‘N’ for non-vegetarian.

Distance in kms must be greater than 0.

Quantity ordered should be minimum 1.

If any of the input is invalid, the bill amount should be considered as -1.

You are keeping score for a baseball game with strange rules. The game consists of several rounds,
 where the scores of past rounds may affect future rounds' scores.

At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record. You are given a list of strings ops,
 where ops[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

1. An integer x - Record a new score of x.
2. "+" - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores. 
It is guaranteed there will always be two previous scores.
3. "D" - Record a new score that is double the previous score. It is guaranteed there will always be
 a previous score.
4. "C" - Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record. 
It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score.

Return the sum of all the scores on the record.
